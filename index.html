    <p><strong>What is the dataset? </strong></p>
  </div>
  <main>
    <p>The  dataset is Country of Birth of person by Year of Arrival in Australia Â </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Why is the dataset collected?</strong></p>
    <p>This  dataset is collected to outline the diversities by country of birth in  Australia.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Which government department do you think will use  this?</strong></p>
    <p>Such  type of dataset would be useful for the Department of Immigration and Border  Protection. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Which private sector will use this?</strong></p>
    <p>This  dataset could be used within private corporations.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>How would this dataset change the way you think  about space?</strong></p>
    <p>It  allows governmental bodies to analyse the use of space based on cultural  differences. For instance, it could be an indicator of where cultural  facilities should be placed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>How does this dataset change across Sydney? </strong></p>
    <p>Those of ethnic origin (Non-western Europeans) tend to stay closer to  each other in select clusters around Sydney. Whilst those of Western European  decent are more likely to spread out with no identifiable clusters, with the  majority closer to the city. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>How does it relate to the latte line? </strong></p>
    <p>Most residents from regions other than Europe tend to live south of the  latte line. This can be stemmed from the fact that many of these residents are  first wave immigrants with naturally lower pay, resulting in the lack of  on-the-go coffees. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>How has the dataset changed between 2011 and 2016? </strong></p>
    <p>The only significant changes are the slight increase of cluster density,  with more people of the same ethnicity residing in the same area; and the  expansion of most clusters. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>How is this dataset significate to people&rsquo;s lives? </strong></p>
    <p>It allows both long-time citizens or those fresh off the boat know where  their ethnic group is most likely located, allowing the feeling of a 'home away  from home' with those of the same ethnicity. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Would it be good for this data to change? </strong></p>
    <p>Not necessarily, the dataset effectively shows location of ethnic  populations through years of arrival. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>If you wanted to change it, how would you change  it?</strong></p>
  </main>
	If there was to be a  change, it would be most likely reducing the years covered in one dataset. It  will provide a far more detailed insight into when immigrants came into  Australia. </div>
